# BioDataScience_Task2.R

Description: Now that I know the basic usage of R, here, I will develop some R codes for solving intermediate to complex scientific problems under different themes.

Skillmap: R, Data Analytics

Aim: To reproduce the following tutorial: https://bioinfo4all.wordpress.com/2021/01/31/tutorial-6-how-to-do-principal-component-analysis-pca-in-r/

Chosen Theme: Microbiology

Task: Study the microbial_stationary_phase.dat dataset here (https://github.com/HackBio-Internship/public_datasets/tree/main/R/mcb)
During microbial growth, there are 3 key phases; lag phase, exponential phase and stationary phase.
For the 10 samples, Determine the time when the bacteria enters its stationary phase.
